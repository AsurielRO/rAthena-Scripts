Previously my scripts for rAthena an Ragnarok Online Server Emulator were hosted on the Google Code Project, 
but since it got disbanded in 2016 I moved to GitHub.
 
## ==== Terms of Service =====
### ========= Scripts =========
My Scripts free of usage for everyone.
In case bugs should appear, pm me on the board mentioned above or send me an mail.
If you should have made modifications by yourself, like adding snippets which isn't part of the original code
I will NOT provide any support. But you are allowed to request that I'm making the modifications.
## ========= END =========

Note: As of August 2019, I continued the Translation Project started by zackdreaver.
So I stopped making scripts so I can focus on that, since it's benefits the community more.
Also I don't have any ideas currently what to script anyway, as I don't deal with official content.
