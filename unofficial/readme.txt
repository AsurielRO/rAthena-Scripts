   As I also did an pull-request on rAthena GIT, I thought I will keep it as backup until it's accepted, in case it gets deleted somehow.
 ============================================

Information based of various sites and other Servers like Nova Ro and Limit Ro.
Credits to them for providing the information.
I only created these on personal request, but releasing it for everyone who wants and needs it!
Since I would have deleted them otherwise, since I don't need it.

As soon these scripts/database entries are officially implemented in rAthena, I will delete them of course!
